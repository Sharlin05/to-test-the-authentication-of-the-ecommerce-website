# to-test-the-authentication-of-the-ecommerce-website
This automation script tests user authentication on a demo shopping website. It first creates a new account by entering user-provided email and password, then logs in using the same credentials to verify successful signup and login. The script uses Selenium WebDriver to automate the entire process.
